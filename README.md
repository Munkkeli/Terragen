# Terragen
An old project of mine. Used to generate simple infinite terrains in Unity.

## Notice
  This project is old, and may contain a lot of problems & bugs. Many of the implementations also aren't optimized at all.
  Use at your own risk ;)

## LibNoise.Unity
I use a noise library called LibNoise, that has been ported to Unity by others. If you are interested in using this library in your own projects, check it out here: https://github.com/ricardojmendez/LibNoise.Unity

## Purpose?
I have made a couple of videos on Youtube with this terrain generation in the background, and many people were interested in a tutorial / source code, so here it is. If you want to, you can check out my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/MunkkeliGaming
